	both boundary and region information. Graph cuts are used to find
	the globally optimal segmentation of the N-dimensional image. The
	obtained solution gives the best balance of boundary and region properties
	among all segmentations satisfying the constraints. The topology
	of our segmentation is unrestricted and both \&ldquo;object\&rdquo;
	and \&ldquo;background\&rdquo; segments may consist of several isolated
	parts. Some experimental results are presented in the context of

	an interesting Gestalt example. A fast implementation of our segmentation

	Abstract = {A general non-parametric technique is proposed for the analysis of
	a complex multimodal feature space and to delineate arbitrarily shaped
	clusters in it. The basic computational module of the technique is
	an old pattern recognition procedure: the mean shift. For discrete
	data, we prove the convergence of a recursive mean shift procedure
	to the nearest stationary point of the underlying density function
	and, thus, its utility in detecting the modes of the density. The
	relation of the mean shift procedure to the Nadaraya-Watson estimator
	from kernel regression and the robust M-estimators; of location is
	also established. Algorithms for two low-level vision tasks discontinuity-preserving
	smoothing and image segmentation - are described as applications.
	In these algorithms, the only user-set parameter is the resolution
	of the analysis, and either gray-level or color images are accepted
	as input. Extensive experimental results illustrate their excellent

	uses 3D sensor data directly to determine a ranked set of grasps
	for objects in a scene, using heuristics based on both the overall
	shape of the object and its local features. The reactive grasping
	approach uses tactile feedback from fingertip sensors to execute
	a compliant robust grasp. We present experimental results to validate
	our approach by grasping a wide range of unknown objects. Our results
	show that reactive grasping can correct for a fair amount of uncertainty
	in the measured position or shape of the objects, and that our grasp
	selection approach is successful in grasping objects with a variety

@article{Murphy04,
	Abstract = {Rescue robotics has been suggested by a recent DARPA/NSF study as
	an application domain for the research in human-robot integration
	(HRI). This paper provides a short tutorial on how robots are currently
	used in urban search and rescue (USAR) and discusses the HRI issues
	encountered over the past eight years. A domain theory of the search
	activity is formulated. The domain theory consists of two parts:
	1) a workflow model identifying the major tasks, actions, and roles
	in robot-assisted search (e.g., a workflow model) and 2) a general
	information flow model of how data from the robot is fused by various
	team members into information and knowledge. The information flow
	model also captures the types of situation awareness needed by each
	agent in the rescue robot system. The article presents a synopsis
	of the major HRI issues in reducing the number of humans it takes
	to control a robot, maintaining performance with geographically distributed
	teams with intermittent communications, and encouraging acceptance
	within the existing social structure.},

@article{Parasuraman00,
	Abstract = {We outline a model for types and levels of automation that provides
	a framework and an objective basis for deciding which system functions
	should be automated and to what extent. Appropriate selection is
	important because automation does not merely supplant but changes
	human activity and can impose new coordination demands on the human
	operator. We propose that automation can be applied to four broad
	classes of functions: 1) information acquisition; 2) information
	analysis; 3) decision and action selection; and 4) action implementation.
	Within each of these types, automation can be applied across a continuum
	of levels from low to high, i.e., from fully manual to fully automatic.
	A particular system can involve automation of all four types at different
	levels. The human performance consequences of particular types and
	levels of automation constitute primary evaluative criteria for automation
	design using our model. Secondary evaluative criteria include automation
	reliability and the costs of decision/action consequences, among
	others. Examples of recommended types and levels of automation are
	provided to illustrate the application of the model to automation
	design},

	Abstract = {Image segmentation is an important problem because it is required
	for many different applications. In particular, visual extraction
	of an object that is the target of attention or manipulation, is
	an increasingly important issue in robot vision. In real-world applications,
	a robot needs to extract an object designated by a human in a complicated
	environment. There is a large literature on the problem of image
	segmentation, but most previous methods have a limited ability to
	extract desired objects from a cluttered scene. Moreover, from the
	perspective of human-robot interfaces, it is desirable to make it
	as easy as possible for the user to indicate an object. In this paper,
	we propose a segmentation method, CD-matting, which can correctly
	extract a target object in complicated real-world visual situations.
	This method exploits color and distance information in an integrated
	way. The system requires only a simple input to designate the target
	object. We verify the proposed system by real-world experiments.
	The results show the effectiveness of our method in complicated situations.},

@inproceedings{Viola01,
	Abstract = {This paper describes a machine learning approach for visual object
	detection which is capable of processing images extremely rapidly
	and achieving high detection rates. This work is distinguished by
	three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image
	representation called the "integral image" which allows the features
	used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a
	learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number
	of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely
	efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining
	increasingly more complex classifiers in a "cascade" which allows
	background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending
	more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can
	be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which
	unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded
	regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain
	of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to
	the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector
	runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing
	or skin color detection.},

	Abstract = {Push is a programming language designed for the
                expression of evolving programs within an evolutionary
                computation system. This article describes Push and
                illustrates some of the opportunities that it presents
                for evolutionary computation. Two evolutionary
                computation systems, PushGP and Pushpop, are described
                in detail. PushGP is a genetic programming system that
                evolves Push programs to solve computational problems.
                Pushpop, an ?autoconstructive evolution? system, also
                evolves Push programs but does so while simultaneously
                evolving its own evolutionary mechanisms.},

                Pixley, majority and Mal'cev terms, showing that GP can

                these terms in either time or size by several orders of
                magnitude. Our terms were produced using the ECJ and
                PushGP genetic programming systems in a variety of
