\section{Introduction}
The UT Austin Villa team, from the University of Texas at Austin, has a long and successful history of RoboCup participation. In 2016, we finished 2nd place in the soccer standard platform league (SPL), and won first place in the 3D simulation league for the 5th time in 6 years.  Although we have also pursued research on domestic and service robots for many years, we have only once participated in RoboCup@Home, finishing in 2nd place in 2007.  This application brings together the laboratories of UT Austin Villa founder and team leader of Prof. Peter Stone with colleagues at UT Austin who are experts in interactive robotics, but who have never participated in RoboCup: Prof. Andrea Thomaz, Prof. Scott Niekum, Prof. Luis Sentis, and Prof. Raymond J. Mooney. Our entry in the 2017 RoboCup@Home competition unites these groups to focus our complementary research in the areas of machine learning, service robotics, human robot interaction, control, and natural language processing towards an entry in the RoboCup@Home SPL using the Toyota Human Support Robot (HSR).
