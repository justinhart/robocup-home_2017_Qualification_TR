\section{Research Focus}

Our main research foci from a technical perspective are on reinforcement learning, especially as applied to real robots, multi-robot systems, human-robot interaction, and learning from demonstration. However we also have a strong history of creating integrated, fully autonomous systems with the idea that integration is an important and valuable research focus in and of itself.  We view RoboCup@Home as a perfect setting for both stretching our core research competencies and for supporting our commitment to integration.

%Examples of our past research innovations related to RoboCup@Home are provided in Section~\ref{sec:tech}.
