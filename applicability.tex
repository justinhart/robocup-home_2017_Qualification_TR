\section{Applicability to the Real World}

We test our systems both in the controlled, simulated home setting of our lab and in the open, dynamic, uncontrolled setting of BWI that
enables any visitor to GDC to interact with the robots.
The former environment enables development within a setting that
closely resembles the RoboCup@Home test arena, while the latter
ensures our software is robust and applicable in real scenarios.

Our innovations related to RoboCup@Home will
be fully evaluated and tested using established HRI experimentation
methods, and incorporated into our ongoing research that will be
submitted for publication in leading AI and robotics conferences and
journals.  We are committed to our research related to RoboCup@Home
contributing to our overall ongoing research agenda on creating fully
autonomous, human-interactive robots that learn and interact in the
real world.
