  abstract = {
    The action language ${\cal BC}$ provides an elegant way of formalizing
      dynamic domains which involve indirect effects of actions and recursively
      defined fluents. In complex robot task planning domains, it may be
      necessary for robots to plan with incomplete information, and reason
      about indirect or recursive action effects. In this paper, we demonstrate
      how ${\cal BC}$ can be used for robot task planning to solve these
      issues. Additionally, action costs are incorporated with planning to
      produce optimal plans, and we estimate these costs from experience making
      planning adaptive.  This paper presents the first application of ${\cal
        BC}$ on a real robot in a realistic domain, which involves human-robot
        interaction for knowledge acquisition, optimal plan generation to
        minimize navigation time, and learning for adaptive planning.

  abstract = {
    Planning in real-world environments can be challenging for intelligent
    robots due to incomplete domain knowledge that results from unpredictable
    domain dynamism, and due to lack of global observability. Action language BC
    can be used for planning by formalizing the preconditions and (direct and
    indirect) effects of actions, and is especially suited for planning in
    robotic domains by incorporating defaults with the incomplete domain
    knowledge. However, planning with BC is very computationally expensive,
    especially when action costs are considered. We introduce algorithm PlanHG
    for formalizing BC domains at different abstraction levels in order to trade
    optimality for significant efficiency improvement when aiming to minimize
    overall plan cost. We observe orders of magnitude improvement in efficiency
    compared to a standard â€œflatâ€ planning approach.
